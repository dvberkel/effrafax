= Introduction =

discrete provides a utility iterate over the subsets of a `Collection`. A _subset_ is a `List`.

= Details =

== Package Detail ==

The package provides three classes. The can be found in the following packages
  * org.effrafax.discrete
    * `class` Subsets
  * org.effrafax.discrete.util
    * `class` KSubsetIterator
    * `class` SubsetIterator

== Usage ==

The `Subsets` class provides static methods which return `Iterable`s. These objects iterate over subsets of the collection and can be uses in the "foreach" loop. The static methods are

|| *Method*     || *Type of subset*    ||
|| `kSubsetsOf` || subsets of size `k` ||
|| `subsetsOf`  || *all* subsets       ||
