#summary Description of discrete.

= Introduction =

discrete provides a utility iterate over the subsets of a `Collection`. A _subset_ is a `List`.

= Details =

== Package Detail ==

The package provides three classes. The can be found in the following packages
  * org.effrafax.discrete
    * `class` Subsets
  * org.effrafax.discrete.util
    * `class` KSubsetIterator
    * `class` SubsetIterator

== Usage ==

The `Subsets` class provides static methods which return `Iterable`s. These objects iterate over subsets of the collection and can be uses in the "foreach" loop. The static methods are

|| *Method*     || *Type of subset*    ||
|| `kSubsetsOf` || subsets of size `k` ||
|| `subsetsOf`  || *all* subsets       ||

== Example ==

The following code illustrates typical usage of the methods mentioned in the Usage section.

The code example shows the usage of `kSubsetsOf`.
{{{
Collection<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
for (List<String> subset : Subsets.kSubsetsOf(names, 2)) {

    System.out.println(subset);
}
}}}
This code yields
{{{
[Alice, Bob]
[Alice, Charlie]
[Bob, Charlie]
}}}

The next example is not very different. Is shows the usage of `subsetsOf`.
{{{
Collection<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");	
for (List<String> subset : Subsets.subsetsOf(names)) {

    System.out.println(subset);
}
}}}
It yields
{{{
[]
[Alice]
[Bob]
[Charlie]
[Alice, Bob]
[Alice, Charlie]
[Bob, Charlie]
[Alice, Bob, Charlie]
}}}
